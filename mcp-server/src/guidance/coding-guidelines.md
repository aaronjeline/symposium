# Coding Guidelines

Agent MUST follow the following guidance:

* **Check that everything builds and don't forget tests**: After making changes, remember to check that the typescript + swift + Rust code builds and to run tests.
* **Auto-commit completed work**: After completing a series of related changes, automatically commit them with a descriptive message. This makes it easier for the user to review progress.
* **Co-authorship**: Include "Co-authored-by: Claude <claude@anthropic.com>" in commit messages to indicate AI collaboration.
* **Design documentation updates**: Update the design documentation as appropriate so that it is kept current. This will help both you and future agents to remember how things work.
* **Update tracking**: For major initiatives, update WIP documentation. For smaller work, update GitHub issues as appropriate.
