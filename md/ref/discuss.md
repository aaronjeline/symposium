# Discuss in Symposium

When you select code in your editor, you'll see a "Discuss in Symposium" tooltip option. Clicking this creates a `<symposium-ref/>` element that gets pasted into your terminal, allowing you to reference that specific code selection in your conversation with the agent.

This makes it easy to ask questions about specific code without having to describe the location or copy-paste the content manually. The agent can use the reference to understand exactly what code you're referring to and provide contextual assistance.
