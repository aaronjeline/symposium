# Collaborative Prompts

*Working together through structured dialogue*

## What are Collaborative Prompts?

Collaborative prompts are structured conversation patterns that help humans and AI work together more effectively. Rather than simple question-and-answer exchanges, they create space for genuine exploration, mutual understanding, and shared discovery.

## Key Principles

- **Spacious attention** - Taking time to understand before rushing to solutions
- **Authentic engagement** - Bringing real concerns and questions rather than diplomatic agreement
- **Shared exploration** - Moving between understanding parts and the whole together
- **Meta-awareness** - Noticing and adjusting collaboration patterns in real-time

## Examples

### The "Make it so?" Pattern
Instead of one person deciding when to move forward:
- "I'm sensing we're ready to implement this. Make it so?"
- Creates space for either agreement or surfacing remaining concerns

### Meta Moments
When either collaborator notices a pattern worth examining:
- "Meta moment - what just happened there?"
- Allows real-time improvement of the collaboration itself

### Beginner's Mind
Approaching familiar problems with fresh perspective:
- "Let me actually look at how this project is structured first"
- Prevents assumptions and pattern-matching errors

## Benefits

- Deeper understanding through genuine dialogue
- Reduced miscommunication and rework
- More creative solutions through diverse perspectives
- Stronger working relationships built on trust

## Getting Started

Try incorporating these patterns into your next collaborative session:
1. Ask "What questions come up for you?" instead of assuming agreement
2. Use "Make it so?" to check readiness before moving forward
3. Call "Meta moment" when you notice communication patterns
4. Approach familiar problems with beginner's mind
