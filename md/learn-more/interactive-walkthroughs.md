# Interactive Walkthroughs

Interactive walkthroughs let agents present code explanations with visual diagrams, comments, and interactive elements directly in your IDE.

## How It Works

Instead of just describing code in chat, agents can:

- **Present visual walkthroughs** with diagrams and step-by-step explanations
- **Leave comments** on specific lines of code
- **Create interactive discussions** where you can reply directly in your editor
- **Show relationships** between different parts of your codebase

## Example

When you ask an agent to explain a complex function, instead of getting a wall of text, you get:

1. A visual diagram showing the flow
2. Inline comments explaining each step
3. Interactive buttons to dive deeper into specific aspects
4. Links to related code and documentation

This creates a much richer collaborative experience than traditional chat-based AI interactions.

## Current Status

âœ… **Available now** - Interactive walkthroughs work with Claude and Q CLI in VSCode

ðŸ™‹ **Help wanted** - We'd love help expanding this to other editors and AI models
