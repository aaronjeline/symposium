# IDE Integration for Context-Aware Discussions

*Bringing AI collaboration directly into your development environment*

## What is IDE Integration?

Symposium's IDE integration brings AI assistance directly into your code editor, creating context-aware conversations that understand your project structure, current work, and development patterns.

## Key Features

### Code-Aware Conversations
- AI understands your project structure and dependencies
- Discussions reference actual code locations and patterns
- Suggestions are tailored to your specific codebase

### Interactive Walkthroughs
- Create guided explanations of code changes
- Add contextual comments at specific code locations
- Generate visual diagrams and flow charts
- Provide interactive buttons for follow-up actions

### Seamless Workflow Integration
- Work directly in your familiar development environment
- No context switching between tools
- Maintain focus while getting AI assistance
- Preserve conversation history alongside code changes

## How It Works

### Taskspaces
Isolated workspaces for focused collaboration:
- Each taskspace is a separate copy of your project
- Work undisturbed without affecting main development
- Easy cleanup when exploration is complete

### Context Understanding
The AI assistant can:
- Navigate your project structure using LSP capabilities
- Find symbol definitions and references
- Search code patterns across files
- Understand git history and changes

### Collaborative Patterns
Built-in support for effective collaboration:
- Structured dialogue patterns
- Progress signaling and completion notifications
- Meta-conversation capabilities for improving collaboration

## Benefits

- **Faster onboarding** - Understand new codebases through guided exploration
- **Better code reviews** - Generate explanatory walkthroughs for complex changes
- **Reduced context switching** - Stay in your development environment
- **Improved documentation** - Create living documentation alongside code

## Getting Started

1. Install the Symposium extension for your IDE
2. Create a new taskspace for your project
3. Start a conversation about your code
4. Use interactive walkthroughs to explore and explain changes

The integration is designed to feel natural and unobtrusive, enhancing your existing development workflow rather than replacing it.
