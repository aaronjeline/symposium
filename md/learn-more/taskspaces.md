# Taskspaces

*Taskspaces* are a way to orchestrate multiple agents working on different copies of your code. They are supported via the Symposium OS X application.
When using agents it is natural to want to do multithings at one time. The Symposium GUI app is designed to help you manage that *Taskspaces* are 

*Isolated workspaces for focused collaboration*

## What are Taskspaces?

Taskspaces are isolated copies of your project where you can work with AI assistance without affecting your main development environment. Each taskspace is a separate workspace that provides a clean, focused environment for exploration, experimentation, and collaboration.

## Key Benefits

### Safe Experimentation
- Work on ideas without risk to your main codebase
- Try different approaches in parallel taskspaces
- Easy cleanup when exploration is complete
- No fear of breaking existing work

### Focused Collaboration
- Each taskspace has a specific purpose and scope
- Conversations stay relevant to the current task
- Clear boundaries help maintain context
- Progress tracking per workspace

### Seamless Integration
- Full access to your project's code and structure
- Git integration for version control within taskspaces
- IDE integration maintains familiar development environment
- Easy switching between taskspaces and main project

## How Taskspaces Work

### Creation
When you create a new taskspace:
1. A complete copy of your project is created
2. The AI assistant is initialized with project context
3. You can set a specific name and description for the task
4. Work begins in the isolated environment

### Collaboration
Within a taskspace, you can:
- Have context-aware conversations about your code
- Generate interactive walkthroughs of changes
- Get assistance with implementation and debugging
- Create documentation alongside development

### Completion
When work is finished:
- Review and commit changes within the taskspace
- Merge valuable work back to your main project
- Archive or delete the taskspace
- Preserve conversation history and insights

## Use Cases

### Code Exploration
- Understanding unfamiliar codebases
- Exploring different architectural approaches
- Learning new frameworks or patterns
- Investigating bugs or performance issues

### Feature Development
- Prototyping new features
- Refactoring existing code
- Adding tests and documentation
- Experimenting with different implementations

### Learning and Onboarding
- Getting familiar with project structure
- Understanding team conventions and patterns
- Learning from AI explanations and walkthroughs
- Building confidence before making changes

## Best Practices

### Naming and Organization
- Use descriptive names that reflect the task purpose
- Include relevant context in the description
- Keep taskspaces focused on specific goals
- Clean up completed or abandoned taskspaces regularly

### Collaboration Patterns
- Start with exploration before implementation
- Use "Make it so?" to confirm readiness before major changes
- Call "meta moments" to improve collaboration in real-time
- Signal completion when work is finished

### Integration with Main Project
- Regularly sync with main branch to avoid conflicts
- Review changes carefully before merging back
- Document insights and decisions for future reference
- Share learnings with team members

## Getting Started

1. **Create a taskspace** - Choose a specific task or exploration goal
2. **Set context** - Provide a clear name and description
3. **Begin collaboration** - Start with questions and exploration
4. **Work iteratively** - Make changes, test, and refine
5. **Signal completion** - Clearly indicate when work is finished
6. **Review and integrate** - Merge valuable changes back to main project

Taskspaces provide the foundation for effective human-AI collaboration by creating safe, focused environments where both parties can work together without constraints or fear of disruption.
