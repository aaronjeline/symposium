# Symposium Demo Script

*Target: 5-minute screencast*

## Opening Hook (30 seconds)

*Camera just shows me, hanging out on my couch.*

Hi! My name is Niko Matsakis. If you don't know me, I'm one of the lead designers of the Rust programming language and I'm also a Senior Principal Engineer. This video is meant as an introduction to the Socratic Shell github org -- and to show off the first project we've been working on!

Well, I say "we", but at the moment, the Socratic Shell project is just me -- but that's why I'm making this video! I am interesting in creating an open-source org dedicated to exploring the potential for AI to make programming easier, more collaborative, and -- well -- just plain *joyful*.

I know there's a lot of skepticism about AI. I've got concerns too. I'm worried about power usage, for example, though I have faith in the smart people banging on the problem that things will get more efficient. And I don't love hallucinations, though I don't honestly find that to be that different from what you see on your average web search these days. If it ain't Wikipedia, I don't trust it.

But for me, using AI tools has just been *tremendously* empowering. It's not just that I get more done, it's that I have a lot more fun doing it. Let me just show you!

## Introducing Symposium

*Launch Symposium, show empty panel*

I'm going to start by launching Symposium. Symposium is one of two projects in the Socratic Shell org. It's an OS X app, though I'd love to have some folks help me port it to windows or linux (hint, hint).

Anyway, you can think of it like a "meta IDE". When you run symposium, you point it at a git repository. It will create a checkout and then help you coordinate various worktrees. 

*Click the open project, explores in the Finder window*

In this case I'm going to be using Symposium on itself, so let me just open up a pre-existing project -- Symposium.symposium. You can see here that a symposium project is just a directory with a bunch of subdirectories.

*Open symposium*

These subdirectories are called *taskspaces*. Each taskspace is a git worktree exploring a particular task-- but each taskspace also has an AI agent in it, pursuing some task. Right now i've just started up, so what you are seeing here are older taskspaces I had from before. There are AI agents in these, running in the background â€”- though probably most of them are just blocked right now, waiting on me to do something.

So, you might be wondering, I thought this was about AI. Why am I looking at some kind of programmer's Window Manager. I mean we already have Xmonad, am I right? Well, the thing is, what I've seen is that, as you get really into AI, you start to want to do more tasks at once. The idea is that you are talking to the agent and you set it up to do some task, but then you just kind of have to wait. And while you wait, you'd like to be doing something else.

So, with symposium, you can really easily start up a new taskspace. One way is to click this button and describe the thing you want to do. LEt me go ahead and spawn a taskspace now.

*[Click new taskspace button]*

So, for this taskspace, I'm going to be adding a feature. You see, when the agent hits some kind of problem, it can use this "signal user" tool to let you know that it wants help. I'd like to extend the app to show a badge on the dock icon so we know that we have been signalled. 

*types that into the taskspace box and hits create*

OK, so, that's launching up. Now, I'm going to make a second taskspace, because I've got this other idea I want to pursue. You see, one of the things that is part of socratic shell is an MCP server that gives access to more structured operations, like IDE operations. I've been thinking about how, when I do a search, I often see the AI follow that up by fetching text *around* the search hit to get context, and I started thinkning, what if search provided a certain amount of context by default? I wanted to play around with this idea a bit.

*types that into the taskspace box and hits create*

OK, so, now you can see I have these two taskspaces going. 

* second, I hvae this cool idea I want to brainstorm.

You can see that each taskspace I've spawned shows up here with some kind of placeholder test. When I click on them, a VSCode window opens up in that new taskspace. This window is running a VSCode extension that

## Notes for Yourself

- Remember to mention productivity gains from dogfooding
- Keep energy high throughout
- Show genuine curiosity and learning
- Emphasize authenticity - this is real workflow, not contrived demo
- End with clear ways for people to get involved

## Technical Setup Reminders

- [ ] Have good Swift bug ready to demonstrate
- [ ] Ensure walkthrough tool renders mermaid beautifully  
- [ ] Test Ask Socratic Shell workflow
- [ ] Verify /reply functionality works smoothly
- [ ] Have GitHub issues ready to show
- [ ] Check that agents can respond naturally to "say hi"
