# Dock-Activated Interface Implementation Plan

*Step-by-step transition from multi-window to dock-activated interface*

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for transitioning Symposium from its current multi-window architecture to the new dock-activated interface with speech bubble-style panel design.

## Current State Assessment

### ‚úÖ What We Have (Reusable)
- **Core Models**: Project, Taskspace, TaskspaceLog data structures
- **ProjectManager**: Complete project and taskspace management logic
- **IPC System**: Working daemon communication and MCP server integration
- **Window Registration**: CGWindowID tracking and screenshot capture
- **SwiftUI Views**: ProjectView, TaskspaceCard, all existing UI components
- **Screenshot System**: ScreenshotManager with ScreenCaptureKit integration
- **Settings & Permissions**: Complete agent selection and permission management

### üîÑ What Changes
- **Window Architecture**: Multi-window ‚Üí Single splash window + floating dock panel
- **Panel Presentation**: Always-visible project windows ‚Üí Dock-click activated panel
- **Project Model**: Multi-project support ‚Üí Single active project at a time
- **Visual Design**: Standard windows ‚Üí Speech bubble panel with dock arrow

### ‚ûï What We Need to Add
- **NSPanel Integration**: Custom panel with system contextual menu styling
- **Dock Interaction**: Click detection and panel positioning logic
- **Panel Lifecycle**: Show/hide behavior with proper focus management
- **Taskspace States**: Two-dimensional Active/Dormant + Hatchling/Resume state model

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 10: NSPanel Foundation üèóÔ∏è

**10.1: Create Custom NSPanel Class**
- [x] Create `DockPanel.swift` - custom NSPanel subclass
- [x] Configure panel styling: `.nonactivatingPanel`, floating level, no title bar
- [x] Add visual styling to match system contextual menus (blur, rounded corners, shadow)
- [x] Implement arrow/tail drawing pointing toward dock

**10.2: SwiftUI Integration**
- [x] Create `DockPanelHostingView` - NSHostingView wrapper for SwiftUI content
- [x] Port existing ProjectView to work inside NSPanel sizing constraints
- [x] Test SwiftUI view lifecycle within NSPanel container
- [x] Ensure proper sizing and layout for ~400px panel width

**10.3: Basic Panel Management**
- [x] Create `DockPanelManager` - handles panel show/hide logic
- [x] Add panel positioning logic relative to dock location
- [x] Implement click-outside-to-dismiss behavior
- [x] Add basic dock click detection (temporary implementation)

**Success Criteria**: NSPanel appears with SwiftUI content, positioned near dock, dismisses properly

### Phase 20: Application Architecture Changes ‚úÖ

**20.1: Modify App.swift Window Structure**
- [x] Remove "project" WindowGroup (multi-project window support)
- [x] Keep "splash" WindowGroup as dedicated Project Selection Window
- [x] Integrate DockPanelManager into app lifecycle (via AppDelegate coordination)
- [x] Add dock click event handling to App.swift (inherited from Phase 10)

**20.2: Single Active Project Model**
- [x] Add `activeProjectPath` to SettingsManager (replace multi-project tracking)
- [x] Modify SplashView to automatically restore last active project on startup
- [x] Add "Close Project" functionality that returns to SplashView
- [x] Update project selection flow to set active project instead of opening windows

**20.3: Splash Window as Project Manager**
- [x] Modify SplashView to handle both project selection AND dock panel management
- [x] Add dock panel integration to SplashView lifecycle (via AppDelegate coordination)
- [x] Ensure splash window persists while project is active (no longer dismissed)
- [x] Handle splash window show/hide when projects are opened/closed (ActiveProjectView)

**Success Criteria**: ‚úÖ App launches with splash window, can open project that shows dock panel, can close project to return to splash

**Implementation Notes**: 
- Created `ActiveProjectView` for managing active project state with "Close Project" functionality
- Renamed `lastProjectPath` ‚Üí `activeProjectPath` across entire codebase for clearer semantics  
- SplashView now manages project lifecycle with `setActiveProject()` and `closeActiveProject()` methods
- Single window architecture: splash window persists and shows different content based on project state
- Full AppDelegate integration for dock panel coordination maintained from Phase 10
- Project restoration on app startup now sets active project instead of opening separate windows

### Phase 22: Improved Project Workflow & XOR Invariant ‚úÖ

**22.1: Implement XOR Invariant (Active Project ‚äï Splash Window Visible)**
- [x] Remove ActiveProjectView entirely (intermediate state not needed)
- [x] Modify setActiveProject() to hide splash window instead of showing ActiveProjectView
- [x] Modify closeActiveProject() to show splash window when project closed
- [x] Update SplashView body logic to never show ActiveProjectView
- [x] Refactor to use proper SwiftUI window management (dismiss/openWindow) instead of NSApp.windows search

**22.2: Immediate Dock Panel on Project Open**
- [x] Show dock panel immediately when project is opened (don't wait for dock click)
- [x] Position dock panel near dock location on project open
- [x] Ensure panel shows dormant taskspaces ready for user activation
- [x] Maintain existing dock click behavior for subsequent panel displays

**22.3: Dock Panel as Primary Project Interface**
- [x] Add "Close Project" functionality to dock panel (red X button)
- [x] Remove "Close Project" from splash window (no longer needed)
- [x] Ensure dock panel can manage all project operations
- [x] Update dock panel to be the sole interface for active projects
- [x] Create callback chain: ProjectView ‚Üí DockPanelManager ‚Üí AppDelegate ‚Üí SplashView

**22.4: Consistent Initial Taskspace Creation**
- [ ] Modify project creation to automatically create one initial taskspace (dormant)
- [ ] Ensure new project taskspaces start dormant until user activation
- [ ] Update existing project loading to show all taskspaces as dormant initially
- [ ] Create consistent experience: all projects open with dormant taskspaces

**Success Criteria**: ‚úÖ Opening project immediately shows dock panel with dormant taskspaces, splash window hidden. Closing project returns to splash. Clean XOR invariant maintained.

**Implementation Notes**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - This creates a much more intuitive workflow where the dock panel becomes both the initial project workspace (letting users activate taskspaces) and the ongoing project interface. Eliminates the awkward "Project Active" intermediate screen. XOR invariant now works through proper SwiftUI window management with dismiss()/openWindow() patterns.

### Phase 30: Enhanced Taskspace State Management üìä

**30.1: Two-Dimensional State Model**
- [ ] Add `PersistentState` enum to Taskspace model: `Hatchling`, `Resume`
- [ ] Add runtime Active/Dormant detection via IPC roll-call system
- [ ] Modify TaskspaceCard to show visual states based on both dimensions
- [ ] Update taskspace.json persistence to include persistent state

**30.2: IPC Roll-Call System**
- [ ] Implement periodic taskspace detection broadcasts
- [ ] Add IPC message types for taskspace presence detection

**30.3: Visual State Indicators**
- [ ] Update TaskspaceCard to show live/grey/placeholder screenshots
- [ ] Add loading states for taskspace awakening process
- [ ] Implement visual feedback for dormant taskspaces being awakened
- [ ] Add state indicators (Active/Dormant badges) to taskspace cards

**Success Criteria**: Taskspaces correctly show Active/Dormant states, visual feedback matches actual window states

### Phase 40: Project Lifecycle & Window Management ü™ü

**40.1: Graceful Project Transitions**
- [ ] Implement project close functionality that closes all VSCode windows

- [ ] Performance optimization (screenshot capture, panel animations)
- [ ] Error handling and edge case management
- [ ] User experience refinements based on testing

**Success Criteria**: Production-ready dock-activated interface with polished UX

- **DockPanelHostingView**: NSHostingView wrapper for SwiftUI integration

### Key Classes to Modify
- **App.swift**: Remove project WindowGroup, add dock panel management
- **SplashView**: Become permanent project manager window
- **SettingsManager**: Add single active project tracking
- **Taskspace.swift**: Add persistent state enum and runtime state tracking

### Key Classes to Reuse Unchanged
- **ProjectManager**: Core project management logic
- **ProjectView**: Main taskspace display (fits perfectly in panel)
- **TaskspaceCard**: Individual taskspace UI (minor sizing adjustments only)
- **ScreenshotManager**: Window screenshot capture system
- **IpcManager**: MCP server communication

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
**Risk**: NSPanel + SwiftUI integration issues
**Mitigation**: Start with simple SwiftUI content, gradually add complexity

**Risk**: Dock click detection reliability
**Mitigation**: Implement temporary solution first, research proper APIs separately

**Risk**: Panel positioning on multiple monitors
**Mitigation**: Test early on multi-monitor setups, provide fallback positioning

**Risk**: SwiftUI layout issues in constrained panel width
**Mitigation**: Test TaskspaceCard layout early, adjust sizing incrementally

### User Experience Risks
**Risk**: Panel feels disconnected from dock interaction
**Mitigation**: Ensure arrow pointing and positioning are precise

**Risk**: Loss of workflow when transitioning from multi-window
**Mitigation**: Preserve all existing functionality, just change presentation

## Success Metrics

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Single dock click shows panel with all active project taskspaces
- [ ] Panel appears positioned near dock with arrow pointing to click location
- [ ] Panel dismisses when clicking outside or pressing escape
- [ ] All existing taskspace functionality preserved (creation, logs, screenshots)
- [ ] Project switching works cleanly (close VSCode windows, return to splash)
- [ ] Taskspaces show correct Active/Dormant states with appropriate visual feedback

### Visual Requirements
- [ ] Panel matches macOS contextual menu styling (blur, rounded corners, shadow)
- [ ] Arrow/tail points accurately toward dock
- [ ] TaskspaceCard layout works well in ~400px panel width
- [ ] Smooth animations for panel show/hide
- [ ] Clear visual states for taskspace Active/Dormant/Hatchling/Resume combinations

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Panel appears within 200ms of dock click
- [ ] Screenshot updates don't impact panel responsiveness
- [ ] Memory usage remains reasonable with panel open/closed cycles
- [ ] No memory leaks from NSPanel/SwiftUI integration

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Phase 10.1**: Create basic DockPanel NSPanel subclass
2. **Test early and often**: Verify NSPanel + SwiftUI integration works
3. **Incremental approach**: Get basic panel working before adding complex features
4. **Preserve existing code**: Reuse current SwiftUI views wherever possible

The beauty of this plan is that most of your hard work (IPC, window management, screenshot capture) stays exactly the same - we're just changing how the UI is presented to the user.
