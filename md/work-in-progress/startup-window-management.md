# Startup Window Management Implementation - COMPLETED ✅

This chapter tracked the implementation of the [Startup and Window Management](../design/startup-and-window-management.md) design document.

## Overview

We successfully transitioned from the current single-window splash system to a four-window architecture with a proper state machine. This involved:

1. **Project Metadata Migration** - Update project schema to include agent and version fields ✅
2. **Window Architecture** - Create four distinct window types (Splash, Settings, Project Selection, Project Window) ✅  
3. **State Machine** - Implement deterministic startup flow ✅
4. **Migration Logic** - Handle existing projects gracefully ✅

## Final Status: ALL PHASES COMPLETE ✅

### Phase 1: Project Metadata Migration ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Update the `Project` struct to match the target schema and handle migration of existing projects.

**Completed**:
- ✅ Added version and agent fields to Project struct
- ✅ Implemented backward-compatible loading with ProjectV0 fallback
- ✅ Added migration logic that auto-saves upgraded projects
- ✅ Updated design document with defaultBranch field
- ✅ Added defaultBranch field to Project struct
- ✅ Updated ProjectManager.createProject() with agent and defaultBranch parameters
- ✅ Updated migration logic to set defaultBranch to nil (auto-detect)
- ✅ Added agent selection and Advanced Settings to project creation UI
- ✅ Updated taskspace creation to use defaultBranch field with auto-detection
- ✅ Tested migration and new project creation

### Phase 2: Window Architecture ✅ COMPLETE

**Completed**:
- ✅ Created Settings window (separate from splash)
- ✅ Created Project Selection window 
- ✅ Created Project Window (main workspace)
- ✅ Added Splash window for startup coordination
- ✅ Updated App.swift with four WindowGroups
- ✅ Implemented proper window lifecycle management
- ✅ Added window dismissal and cleanup logic

### Phase 3: State Machine Implementation ✅ COMPLETE

**Completed**:
- ✅ Implemented `runStartupLogic()` coordinator function
- ✅ Added window management helpers (openWindow, dismissWindow, etc.)
- ✅ Implemented state transitions and validation
- ✅ Handled error cases and edge conditions
- ✅ Fixed race conditions (agent scanning vs project restoration)
- ✅ Added automatic window refresh on project restoration
- ✅ Streamlined UX (direct file picker, no intermediate dialogs)
- ✅ Proper project cleanup when windows close

## Key Implementation Insights

### Race Condition Resolution
The biggest challenge was a race condition where project restoration happened before agent scanning completed, causing "waiting for daemon" issues. Solution: Wait for `agentManager.scanningCompleted` before restoring projects.

### Window Lifecycle Management
Proper window dismissal was crucial. Each window's `onDisappear` handler clears state and re-runs startup logic to determine the next appropriate window.

### UX Streamlining
Eliminated unnecessary intermediate dialogs by making "Open Existing Project" directly show the file picker instead of going through a single-button dialog.

### Automatic Window Refresh
Added automatic `reregisterWindows()` call after project restoration to eliminate the need for users to manually click refresh buttons.

## Migration to Main Design Document

All architectural decisions and implementation details have been incorporated into the main [Startup and Window Management](../design/startup-and-window-management.md) design document. This WIP document can now be archived.

**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE** - All phases implemented and tested successfully.
