# UI Hover & Click Feedback Enhancement

## Overview

Adding subtle hover effects and click feedback to the Symposium project view to improve user experience and provide clear visual feedback for interactive elements.

## Requirements

### Hover Effects
- **TaskspaceCard**: Subtle background color change on mouseover (similar to Finder/Mail list items)
- **Buttons**: Consistent hover states for all buttons (trash, expand, plus, refresh, close)
- **Consistency**: Same hover treatment for active and dormant taskspaces
- **Always Active**: Hover effects should work even when Symposium app is not the active application

### Click Feedback
- **Brief flash**: Color flash on click (similar to standard macOS button press)
- **Duration**: ~200ms to match system button behavior
- **Scope**: Apply to taskspace cards and their custom buttons

### Click-Through Behavior
- **Direct Action**: Clicking on a taskspace should activate it even if Symposium app is not currently active
- **No Double-Click**: Avoid the typical macOS pattern where first click activates app, second click performs action
- **Live Window**: Hover effects signal that the window is "live" and responsive

### Design Decisions
- Use macOS-native patterns (subtle gray/blue tint for hover)
- Standard OS elements already have built-in effects, focus on custom UI
- Avoid border glows or elevation effects in favor of background color changes

## Implementation Plan

1. Add hover state tracking to `TaskspaceCard`
2. Add click/press state tracking for flash feedback
3. Apply hover background color changes
4. Implement click flash animations
5. Apply consistent hover states to custom buttons
6. **Ensure click-through behavior**: Configure window/view to handle clicks even when app is inactive

## Status
- [x] TaskspaceCard hover effects (including when app inactive)
- [x] TaskspaceCard click feedback
- [x] Button hover states (expand, delete, plus, refresh, close, back)
- [x] Click-through behavior for direct taskspace activation
- [x] Build verification - all changes compile successfully
- [ ] User testing and refinement

## Implementation Details

### TaskspaceCard Effects
- **Hover**: Subtle background color change from `0.05` to `0.08` opacity
- **Click Flash**: Brief flash to `0.2` opacity for 100ms
- **Animation**: Smooth transitions with `easeInOut` timing

### Button Hover States
- **Cursor**: Pointer hand cursor on hover for all custom buttons
- **Disabled State**: Hover effects respect button disabled state
- **Consistency**: All buttons use same hover treatment

### Technical Notes
- Uses SwiftUI `@State` for hover and press tracking
- Animations use `easeInOut` with appropriate durations
- Click flash implemented with `DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter`
- Build completed successfully with only existing warnings (unrelated to changes)
