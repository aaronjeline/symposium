# Project Window Visual Design

*Full-screen overlay interface for dock-activated taskspace management*

## Overview

Symposium's project interface uses a full-screen overlay system that provides immersive, focused interaction with taskspace management. The interface is inspired by macOS Spotlight and Mission Control, creating a familiar yet powerful workspace orchestration experience.

## User Experience

### Interaction Model
- **Dock activation**: Clicking the Symposium dock icon reveals the project interface
- **Full-screen context**: Semi-transparent overlay (70% black) provides focus while maintaining desktop awareness
- **Centered presentation**: Project content appears in an organized, predictable layout regardless of screen size or dock position
- **Spatial depth**: Smooth animations suggest content moving through 3D space, creating natural entry and exit transitions

### Interface Behavior
- **Immediate immersion**: Full-screen overlay creates distraction-free interaction space
- **Intuitive dismissal**: Click outside content area or press Escape to return to desktop
- **Consistent positioning**: Always centered horizontally and vertically, eliminating positioning unpredictability
- **Responsive design**: Adapts gracefully to different screen sizes and taskspace counts

## Visual Design

### Animation System

**Appearance Transition:**
The interface materializes with a sophisticated depth animation that suggests content emerging from behind the user and settling into comfortable viewing distance:

1. **Instant overlay**: Semi-transparent black background (70% opacity) covers the entire screen
2. **Scale transition**: Content begins at full screen size and smoothly contracts to its final centered dimensions
3. **Settling effect**: As the panel shrinks, it appears to recede from extreme close-up to optimal viewing distance

**Dismissal Transition:**
Dismissal reverses the entry animation, creating a sense of the interface retreating back into the system:

1. **Expansion**: Panel grows from centered size toward full screen dimensions
2. **Fade transition**: Background overlay dissolves as content reaches screen edges
3. **Seamless return**: Smooth transition back to desktop without jarring visual breaks

### Visual Metaphor
The animation system employs a **depth-based interaction model** where content moves through perceived 3D space. This creates the sensation that the interface is initially overwhelming close (full-screen), then naturally settles back to a comfortable, organized viewing distance where users can effectively interact with their taskspaces.

## Layout System

### Adaptive Layout System

**Intelligent Sizing:**
The interface automatically calculates optimal dimensions based on content requirements and screen constraints:

- **Content-driven width**: Taskspace cards size themselves based on typical log message length (*"Scotty, take us out here! Warp nine!"*)
- **Flexible columns**: 3-4 taskspaces per row, with column count adapting to screen width
- **Bounded dimensions**: Panel never exceeds comfortable screen proportions regardless of content volume

**Vertical Organization:**
- **Fixed header**: Project information and essential controls remain consistently accessible
- **Primary rows**: First two rows of taskspaces always visible without scrolling
- **Overflow handling**: Additional taskspaces accessible via smooth scrolling within the panel
- **Dynamic height**: Panel adjusts vertically based on actual taskspace count while maintaining usable proportions

### Content Organization

The interface presents taskspaces in a clean, structured grid:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Project: MyApp                      [X] │ ← Project header
│ ─────────────────────────────────────── │
│                                         │
│ [Taskspace 1] [Taskspace 2] [Task 3]   │ ← Primary row
│                                         │
│ [Taskspace 4] [Taskspace 5] [Task 6]   │ ← Secondary row
│                                         │
│ ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐ │ ← Additional content
│ │ [Additional taskspaces...]          │ │   (scrollable)
│ └─────────────────────────────────────┘ │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Information Architecture:**
- **Project header**: Displays active project name with close control
- **Taskspace grid**: Cards arranged in logical rows with consistent spacing
- **Content hierarchy**: Essential taskspaces immediately visible, additional content accessible via scrolling
- **Visual clarity**: Clean separation between interface elements with thoughtful use of whitespace

## Technical Implementation

### Window Architecture
The interface uses a full-screen NSWindow approach that provides complete control over presentation and animation while maintaining system integration:

- **Overlay foundation**: Transparent window with custom background rendering
- **Animation system**: Core Animation-based transforms for smooth, hardware-accelerated transitions
- **Focus management**: Proper handling of window focus, keyboard shortcuts, and system integration
- **Performance optimization**: Efficient rendering and memory management for responsive interaction

### Integration Points
- **Dock interaction**: Seamless activation from dock clicks with appropriate window level management
- **System events**: Proper handling of screen changes, system sleep/wake, and focus transitions
- **Accessibility**: Full VoiceOver support and keyboard navigation
- **Multi-display**: Intelligent positioning across different monitor configurations

## Design Philosophy

The full-screen overlay approach embodies several key design principles:

**Familiarity**: Builds on established macOS interaction patterns (Spotlight, Mission Control) that users already understand and expect

**Focus**: Creates a dedicated interaction space that eliminates environmental distractions while maintaining visual connection to the desktop context

**Predictability**: Consistent, centered presentation eliminates positioning variability and provides reliable user experience across different setups

**Scalability**: Responsive layout system gracefully handles projects with varying taskspace counts without compromising usability

**Performance**: Hardware-accelerated animations and efficient rendering ensure smooth interaction even on older systems

This design creates a sophisticated yet intuitive interface that feels naturally integrated with macOS while providing powerful workspace orchestration capabilities.
