Symposium empowers developers to collaborate naturally with AI assistants. Instead of cramming everything into a single chat, create focused workspaces where you and your AI partner can work together effectively.

## Features

<div class="feature-grid">

### Walkthroughs -- discuss and review code
Select any code in your editor and discuss it with your AI assistant. Get interactive explanations with clickable references, diagrams, and step-by-step breakdowns that help you understand what changed and why.

### Smarter agents -- because awk and sed are so 70s  
Your AI assistant gets modern tools for code navigation, symbol lookup, and intelligent search. No more crude text processing - work with actual code structure and IDE capabilities.

### Taskspaces -- work on multiple things at once
Create separate workspaces for different projects or tasks. Each maintains its own context and conversation history, so you can debug production issues in one space while exploring new features in another.
