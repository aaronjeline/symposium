# Unopinionated setup

Symposium's *goal* is be unopinionated and support a wide varity of setups. However, the reality is...rather more humbling. We have however designed the various pieces to be readily extended:

* We build on standards wherever possible!
* The Rust MCP server should be broadly portable.
* The IDE extension is meant to contain only minimal logic that could be readily reproduced.
* The Symposium App uses OS X accessibility APIs to generally manipulate Windows "from the outside".

We would love to get [contribution](../contribute.md) to add support for more editors and operating systems!
