## Instructions

### Using the Symposium GUI app

If you are on a Mac, we recommend you use the Symposium GUI app. This app will allow you to have multiple [taskspaces](./learn-more/taskspaces.md) at once, letting you use many agents concurrently.

Steps to open the app:

* Clone the project from github
    * `git clone https://github.com/symposium-dev/symposium`
* To build and start the desktop app (OS X only):
    * `cargo setup --all --open`

### Using the VSCode plugin + the MCP server

If you don't want to use the GUI app, or you don't have a Mac, you can use the VSCode plugin and the MCP server independently:

* Clone the project from github
    * `git clone https://github.com/symposium-dev/symposium`
* To build and start the desktop app (OS X only):
    * `cargo setup --vscode --mcp`

### Using just the MCP server

You can also use *just* the MCP server. This will give access to some limited functionality such as the ablity to [fetch Rust crate sources](./learn-more/api-examples.md).

* Clone the project from github
    * `git clone https://github.com/symposium-dev/symposium`
* To build and start the desktop app (OS X only):
    * `cargo setup --mcp`
