# Elevator pitch

> What are you proposing to change? Bullet points welcome.

# Status quo

> How do things work today and what problems does this cause? Why would we change things?

# Shiny future

> How will things will play out once this feature exists?

**NOTE:** This section is *OPTIONAL*. It is perfectly find to open an RFD with just a status quo or with only a high-level sketch of what you might like to be different and to invite feedback and discussion on whether it's a problem worth solving.

# Implementation plan

> What is your implementaton plan?

**NOTE:** Do not bother with this section while the RFD is in "Early drafts" phase unless you've got a pretty clear idea how you think it should work and/or have things you particularly want to highlight. This will typically be authored and updated by an agent as implementation work proceeds.

# Frequently asked questions

> What questions have arisen over the course of authoring this document or during subsequent discussions? Keep this section up-to-date as discussion proceeds. The goal is to capture major points that came up on a PR or in a discussion forum -- and if they reoccur, to point people to the FAQ so that we can start the dialog from a more informed place.

## What alternative approaches did you consider, and why did you settle on this one?

None. The idea came to me fully formed, like Athena springing from Zeus's head. <!-- You...may want to adjust this. -->

# Revision history

If there have been major updates to this RFD, you can include the git revisions and a summary of the changes.
