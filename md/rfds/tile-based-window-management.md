# Elevator pitch

> What are you proposing to change? Bullet points welcome.

Enable users to tile multiple taskspace windows so they can monitor progress across several tasks simultaneously, rather than switching between hidden windows.

# Status quo

> How do things work today and what problems does this cause? Why would we change things?

Currently, users can choose between "free windows" (taskspaces positioned anywhere) and "stacked" mode (where only one taskspace is visible at a time). While free windows allow multiple taskspaces to be visible, they can overlap and become disorganized. Stacked mode keeps things tidy but limits visibility to one taskspace. There's no middle ground that provides organized, non-overlapping visibility of multiple taskspaces simultaneously.

# Shiny future

> How will things will play out once this feature exists?

Users can choose a "grid" mode that creates multiple organized stacks - essentially a hybrid between free windows and stacked mode. Each grid cell contains a stack of taskspaces, allowing users to see several taskspaces simultaneously in a clean, non-overlapping layout. Users can configure the grid size (2x2, 1x3, etc.) and assign taskspaces to specific grid positions, providing organized visibility across multiple concurrent tasks.

**NOTE:** Do not bother with this section while the RFD is in "Draft" phase unless you've got a pretty clear idea how you think it should work and/or have things you particularly want to highlight. This will typically be authored and updated by an agent as implementation work proceeds.

# Frequently asked questions

> What questions have arisen over the course of authoring this document or during subsequent discussions? Keep this section up-to-date as discussion proceeds. The goal is to capture major points that came up on a PR or in a discussion forum -- and if they reoccur, to point people to the FAQ so that we can start the dialog from a more informed place.

## What alternative approaches did you consider, and why did you settle on this one?

None. The idea came to me fully formed, like Athena springing from Zeus's head. <!-- You...may want to adjust this. -->
