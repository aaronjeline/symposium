# Product Overview

Symposium is an exploratory open-source project that creates a collaborative AI development environment. It aims to be **opinionated about how you work with agents** while remaining **unopinionated about the tools you use**.

## Core Features

- **Taskspaces**: GUI workspaces for managing multiple agents and their progress
- **Interactive Walkthroughs**: Rich code tours that go beyond text-based interactions
- **Collaborative Prompts**: Enhanced human-agent collaboration workflows
- **IDE Integration**: Context-aware discussions within your existing editor
- **Rust-focused tooling**: Language-specific extensions for better code assistance

## Project Status

⚠️ **Pre-alpha software** - Expect frequent changes and instability. Installation currently requires building from source.

## Core Tenets

- **Open**: Independent community-driven development with RFD process
- **Collaborative**: Rich human-agent interactions for exploring complex ideas
- **Orchestrated**: Tools for managing multiple agents with progress tracking
- **Decentralized**: Engaging library authors to help users succeed with AI
- **Interoperable**: Support for existing editors, agents, and tools (no lock-in)
