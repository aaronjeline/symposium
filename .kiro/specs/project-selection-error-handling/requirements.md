# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the user experience issue where the macOS Symposium app silently returns to the main project selection screen when users attempt to open an invalid directory (one without a `project.json` file). Currently, users receive no feedback about why their selection failed, leading to confusion and frustration. This enhancement will provide clear, informative error messages to guide users toward successful project selection.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a macOS app user, I want to receive clear feedback when I select an invalid directory, so that I understand why my selection failed and know how to proceed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a directory that does not contain a `project.json` file THEN the system SHALL display an informative error message explaining the validation failure
2. WHEN the error message is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on how to resolve the issue (create new project vs select valid existing project)
3. WHEN the error message is dismissed THEN the system SHALL return the user to the project selection screen
4. WHEN the error occurs THEN the system SHALL NOT silently fail or return to the main screen without explanation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a macOS app user, I want the error message to be visually distinct and easy to understand, so that I can quickly identify the problem and take corrective action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error message is displayed THEN the system SHALL use native macOS alert styling for consistency
2. WHEN the error message appears THEN the system SHALL include a clear title indicating the nature of the problem
3. WHEN the error message is shown THEN the system SHALL provide actionable next steps in the message body
4. WHEN the alert is displayed THEN the system SHALL include appropriate button options (OK, Cancel, etc.)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the error handling system to be maintainable and extensible, so that additional validation rules can be easily added in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new validation rules are added THEN the system SHALL support custom error messages for each validation type
2. WHEN validation logic changes THEN the system SHALL maintain separation between validation logic and error presentation
3. WHEN error messages need updates THEN the system SHALL allow easy modification without changing core validation logic
4. WHEN debugging validation issues THEN the system SHALL provide sufficient logging information to identify the root cause
